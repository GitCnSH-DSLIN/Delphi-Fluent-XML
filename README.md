# Fluent XML Writer for Delphi

This is just a simple fluent api for generating XML. It is based on the work of 
Primoz Gabrijelcic - GpFluentXml

http://17slon.com/blogs/gabr/files/GpFluentXml.pas

This version uses MSXML rather than OmniXML. Other than that, it's pretty much the 
same. 

This code is not well tested, but I have used it in a project with good results.

TODO : Unit Tests and examples!
